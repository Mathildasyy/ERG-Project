# ERG2050_Project_PredictHousePrices

## Background

House prices can be affected by many factors from type of utilities available, style of dwelling to rating of basement finished area and fireplace quality. Our goal is to predict the likely house prices according to some potential influencing factors.

The data set includes the information of 1460 sample houses with 79 variables such as the building class, the general zoning classification, linear feet of street connected to property and their corresponding sale price in dollars , what we are going to predict.

## Statistical Learning Task

First, we will analyze 'SalePrice' and its relationship with numerical and categorical futures.

Next, we are going to fix potential problems, for instance, heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, missing data and outliers.

After converting categorical variables into dummy ones, we will train on different regression methods (linear regression, SVM) and integrate them into a blended one.
